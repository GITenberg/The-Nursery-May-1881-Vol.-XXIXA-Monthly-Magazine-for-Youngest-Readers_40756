</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ORWARD, my brave boys!" shouted Colonel Bob,
rising in his stirrups, and waving his sword. "You
see the enemy before you. Charge!"</div>

<p>There stood the enemy in stern defiance,&mdash;four chairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one table, and a sofa,&mdash;there they stood, with a plastered
wall in their rear, and calmly awaited the attack.</p>

<p>The fiery steed of Colonel Bob reared and plunged, as if
eager to dash upon the foe. The roll of the drum made a
fearful sound. The standard-bearer waved his flag. The
army came rushing on. Snap the dog barked furiously.
But above all the din was heard the shout of Colonel Bob,
"Forward, my brave boys!"</p>

<p>Not a picture started from its frame. Not a chair moved.
But all of a sudden the door opened, and a face looked in.
It was Colonel Bob's papa.</p>

<p>"What's all this noise about, Robert?" said he. "This
is not the place for such games. Go out of doors if you
want to play soldier. I can't have such a drumming and
shouting in the house."</p>

<p>This was rather a damper on Colonel Bob's military zeal;
but what came next was still worse.</p>

<p>"Do any of you boys know where to-day's 'Advertiser'
is?" asked papa.</p>

<p>Colonel Bob came down from his high horse, threw aside
his plume, took off his chapeau, and handed it to his papa.</p>

<p>There was the "Advertiser" of that very day, folded up
as a soldier-cap.</p>

<p>"Well, that's pretty business," said his papa, laughing.
"Please give me a chance to read the papers before you use
them in this way." And he went out and shut the door.</p>

<p>Colonel Bob stood leaning on his horse as if in deep
thought. At last he said, "Boys, this movement has failed.
We must change our base. Follow me." And he led the
army out into the back garden.</p>

<h2>PAPA ROBIN.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 62px;">
<img src="images/drop_o.png" width="62" height="150" alt="O" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />NE summer morning Elizabeth sat on the doorstep,
reading. But she looked up often to see the birds
fly about, or to watch the butterflies go sailing past.</div>

<p>By and by she heard a shrill chirping. "Poor
little bird," she thought, "where can it be? Is it
hurt?" She went out into the yard, and looked about her.</p>

<p>There, under a tree, was a baby-bird that had fallen out of
its nest. Elizabeth took it up gently. As it lay in her
hand, it looked like a soft ball. It chirped as loud as it
could, and fluttered.</p>

<p>"Poor birdie," said Elizabeth, "I will try and take you
home." And she looked up into the tree. She could see
the nest the fledgling had tumbled out of; but she was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
tall enough to reach it: so she stood on a knot in the trunk
of the tree, and put the nestling in its home.</p>

<p>She saw the father and the mother-bird in the tree, and
said to herself that they would take care of the little one.
Then she went back to her reading.</p>

<p>Pretty soon she heard the chirping again. This time she
knew where to look, and there was the baby-bird on the
ground, crying and fluttering as before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/illus133.png" width="316" height="400" alt="Girl holding baby robin next to the tree; parent birds flying around" />
</div>

<p>"Papa and mamma Robin ought to take care of you,
birdling," she said. But she stepped on the knotted tree-trunk,
and put back the bird a second time.</p>

<p>Then she sat down on the doorstep, and watched to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
what the parent-birds would do. They flew here and there
about the nest, and sang a few notes that Elizabeth knew
must be bird-talk. She wondered if they were trying to
find a better place for their baby.</p>

<p>But as she was thinking how much care they were taking
of it, out tumbled the little one a third time. "You stupid
old robin!" she cried. "Do you expect some one to be
putting back your birdie for you all day? Why don't you
keep it in the nest?"</p>

<p>She picked up the birdie, and was about to put it back a
third time, when, as she held it, a strange thing happened;
for down flew the robin, and gave her a sharp peck on the
forehead.</p>

<p>Elizabeth stood still. She didn't know what to make of
this. But soon she began to laugh; and then she put the
baby-bird gently on the ground, and went away. She at
last understood what papa Robin meant to say to her by his
peck. This is it: "Don't interfere when I'm teaching my
child to fly. You are very big, and perhaps you know a
great deal; but you don't seem to know that it's not right
to keep birds in the nest all summer. They would never
find out what their wings are for."</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />TOP, Carlo! Come back, sir! Be still!" cried Jane,
trying to hold the little dog by a string tied to his
collar.</div>

<p>But Carlo was in chase of two ducklings, and did
not mind Jane's call. Of course the ducklings took
to the water. Carlo ran after them to the water's edge, but
there he stopped.</p>

<p>What stopped him? Jane was tugging pretty hard at the
string. That was one thing that held him back; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was not all. Carlo was not fond of the water; but he would
not have stopped for that.</p>

<p>I will tell you what stopped him. While the ducklings
were swimming away for dear life, the old mother-duck
came sailing boldly up, with her great yellow beak, and
faced Master Carlo.</p>

<p>She looked like a sloop-of-war all ready for action. Carlo
was a brave dog; but he was afraid of her, for all that. So
he stood still and barked.</p>

<p>Madam Duck did not mind his noise in the least. She
quacked at him fiercely. This is what she meant to say:
"Look here, my young friend, you are a dog, and I am a
duck. You are at home on the land, but I am at home on
the water. Bark as much as you please, but, if you know
what is good for your health, keep out of this pond, and let
my ducklings alone."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Carlo?" said Jane. "Now don't
stop to answer, but come with me like a good dog, and we
will have a run in the woods."</p>

<p>And then Carlo gave up his chase of the ducks, and went
quietly where Jane led him.</p>

I mean to say, "you naughty cat!"<br />

What, call my poor old Tabby cross!<br />
I'm sure she's very good with <i>me</i>;<br />
For, when <i>I</i> go to aunty Gray's,<br />
She always close beside me stays.<br />
If I sit down, she climbs my knee,<br />
And rubs her head against my cheek,<br />
And acts as though she'd like to speak,<br />
And say she wants my friend to be.<br />
I'd rather have her for my own<br />
Than all the cats I've ever known:<br />
Black, yellow, Maltese, large and small,<br />
Old Tab's the nicest of them all.<br />

Yes, Tabby <i>is</i> a knowing cat.<br />
When you have been at aunty Gray's,<br />
She's proved you both, and learned your ways:<br />
She finds that Jack would never fail<br />
To try and swing her by the tail,<br />
While Jane will softly stroke her fur;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>So she will answer by a purr,<br />
To show Jane's gentle touch she likes,<br />
But Jack, with her sharp claws, she strikes.<br />
My mother says we ought to treat<br />
With love each living thing we meet,<br />
And even pussy-cats can tell<br />
Who are the ones that use them well.<br />

wearing mittens and tippets and thick coats when they go
out to play, Willy and Ben are running about bare-headed
in the orange-groves, or plucking roses from the garden.</p>

<p>All around the house are orange-trees, and in among the
glossy green leaves hang the great yellow juicy oranges.
The fruit is ripe early in December, and ready to be picked.</p>

<p>Miles, the colored man, takes his big clippers and goes up
the high step-ladder which he has placed near the tree. He
cuts each orange from the branch, taking care not to get
hurt by the long, sharp thorns.</p>

<p>Willy stands at the foot of the ladder, ready to catch the
oranges as Miles tosses them down. Sometimes they pick
five or six baskets in an afternoon. Miles says Willy is a
"bery good catch." He sometimes tires of catching them;
but he never tires of eating them.</p>

<p>I looked into the packing-room this morning, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
lay seventeen hundred yellow balls. Papa lets both his little
boys help wrap the oranges. Each orange is wrapped in a
piece of tissue-paper that is cut just the right size. Willy
always says as he begins, "Now let's see who'll beat!" Do
you know what he means?</p>

<p>Ben cannot wrap oranges as fast as Willy; but, as they
are wrapped, he hands them to papa to pack in boxes. He
can read the word "Boston"
that papa writes
in black letters
on the outside of
the boxes.</p>

<p>Of course papa
pays his workers,
and they take
their money all to
mamma to keep
for them. They
have so much
whispering to do
about it, that
I think they are
saving it
to buy
holiday
gifts.</p>

"<span class="smcap">When</span> I was little," said grandma Gray,<br />
"We used to welcome the month of May<br />
With a song and a dance on the village green,<br />
Choosing and crowning our May-day queen.<br />
We used to choose of the prettiest girls,<br />
The one who had the sunniest curls,<br />
The one who had the merriest eyes,<br />
As clear and bright as the May-day skies.<br />
<br />
"We made her throne of the daisies white,<br />
And of yellow buttercups, golden bright,<br />
And we twined gay blossoms about the hair<br />
Of our dear little queen so sweet and fair."<br />
So grandma said, and the children heard,<br />
And a loving thought in each heart was stirred;<br />
And they whispered together, and laughed in glee,<br />
"Dear grandmamma shall our May-queen be!"<br />

Then they brought the chair with the cushioned seat,<br />
And the cushioned footstool for grandma's feet,<br />
And led her merrily to the throne,<br />
And crowned her queen of their hearts alone.<br />
They twined the daisies and buttercups bright<br />
In the queen's soft hair so silvery white,<br />
And better than jewels or necklace rare,<br />
Were the clasping arms of those children fair.<br />

Crowned by the children their "Queen of May."<br />

<h2>PIGGY'S SPOON.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/drop_p.png" width="75" height="150" alt="P" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />IGGY had a little house close by the barn. There
were two rooms in his house. In one room he had
his bed; in the other he had a trough.</div>

<p>On one side of his house there was a door that
opened into a pen. The pen was in the orchard
where the sweet apples grew. Sometimes in summer the
apples would fall down from the trees into the pen; then
piggy would pick them up and eat them. Sometimes they
would strike him on his back when they fell; but he did not
mind that; he was always glad to get them.</p>

<p>He had his bed of warm straw to sleep in at night, and
every day he had as much as he wanted to eat. He had all
a pig could wish for: so he was contented. One morning
farmer Jackson brought a pailful of milk for piggy's breakfast.
He poured the milk into the trough, and piggy made
haste to come and eat it.</p>

<p>While he was eating, something hard and cold came into
his mouth. He bit it, but found that it was not good: so he
left it. He ate up all the milk. When it was gone, he saw
a bright silver spoon in the bottom of the trough.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said piggy, "I see how it is. They would like to
have me eat with a spoon; but they would never make me
fat in that way. I should be hungry all the time. Now I
can eat fast and grow fast, and I like my own way best."</p>

<p>So piggy turned up his nose at the spoon. Then he went
out into the pen, and began to root in the dirt to find bits
of apple. "Fine work I should make using a spoon," said
piggy, and he laughed whenever he thought of it.</p>

<p>At night farmer Jackson came to bring his supper. He
saw the spoon in the trough, took it out and carried it into
the house. When his wife saw it, she said somebody had
been very careless, and dropped the spoon into piggy's pail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
She could not find out who had done it, though she asked
everybody. Then she thought that perhaps she had done it
herself. She was glad to get her spoon back again, and
piggy was glad to have it taken from the trough.</p>

<p>He had left the print of his teeth on it: so it was afterwards
called "Piggy's spoon."</p>

it?" cried three excited little voices, as three little
boys came running into the room.</div>

<p>"Have what?" said grandma smiling, as she
looked up from her book. "The measles?"</p>

<p>"Why, grandma, of course it isn't the measles," said Ned,
the eldest. "It is a dog,&mdash;a real puppy. Mrs. James told
Arthur she would give it to him, if you were willing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandma thought of her nice flower-beds and her well-kept
driveway. She did not want to have a dog running
about in them. But then she saw the three wistful faces
waiting for her answer, and so she said "Yes."</p>

<p>Mrs. James had promised that she would bring it to
Arthur by Saturday. All the boys were in haste for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
day to come, and Arthur said, "Now, mamma, there will
be three days more and then 'dog-day.'"</p>

<p>Saturday came at last. Arthur sat by the front-door
watching. About four o'clock in the afternoon, he came
to me and said, very sadly, "Do you really think she will
come to-day, mamma?"&mdash;"Yes," said I.</p>

<p>He took his seat on the steps, and in a few minutes I
heard a joyful cry: "Here's my dog! here's my dog!"
The other boys joined in the shout. Was there ever such
joy!</p>

<p>Bouncer,&mdash;for that was the puppy's name,&mdash;was a fine
water-spaniel. He grew very fast, and proved very kind
and playful. The three boys became very fond of him.
The first thing in the morning, and the last thing at night,
they would all rush out of doors for a romp with Bouncer.</p>

<p>He was always ready for a frolic. Nothing pleased him
so much as a dash into the lake. Then he was in his glory.
He would spring into the water after any thing that the
boys would throw.</p>

<p>Once he saved a man's hat that had blown overboard;
and if the man had gone over with his hat, I have no doubt
that Bouncer would have saved him too. But, as the man
was safe on shore all the time, Bouncer had no chance to
prove himself a hero. That wasn't Bouncer's fault, you
know.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />IS real name was Miles; but one of his papa's friends
said that such a little chap was too small to be called
Miles, and it would be better to begin with "Inches"
and go up gradually: so we nicknamed him "Inches."</div>

<p>His papa and mamma were Americans; but their
little boy was born in Assam, and until he was four years
old he had never seen any other country.</p>

<p>Now, you will want to know where Assam is. I will tell
you. It is a kingdom in India, lying west of China, and
south of the great Himalaya Mountains. Some peaks of
these mountains can be seen on a clear day from the house
where Inches lived.</p>

<p>One morning early, our little friend woke, and called out
in the Assamese language (for he could not speak English),
"Tezzan, take me."</p>
<div>
<img src="images/illus156a.png" alt="Miles and Tezzan" width="600" height="330" class="split" />

</div>
<p>Tezzan his "bearer"&mdash;so a man-nurse is called in Assam&mdash;came
quickly, and dressed his little charge. Then, after
giving him a slice of dry toast and a nice plantain for his
breakfast, he took the little boy by the hand, and started
out with him for their regular morning-walk.</p>

<p>They went down along the bank of the Brahmaputra
River, and saw many sights that would look very strange
to Americans. A little below the house, Inches called on
Tezzan to stop, and let him watch some elephants that were
swimming across the river. He called the elephant a <i>hatee</i>,
giving the "a" in the word the same sound we give it when
we say father.</p>

<p>All they could see of the elephants was the tops of their
heads, and occasionally their trunks when they threw them
out of the water for a fresh breath of air. The drivers
stood on the necks of the elephants, with only a rope, tied
round the great creatures' necks, to hold on by.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by they came struggling up the bank, one after
another,&mdash;eight of them,&mdash;and stood panting and dripping
to rest a little. Scarcely had they set their feet on dry land
when a little ferry-boat came steaming along, and just as
she got close to the bank she blew a long, loud whistle.</p>

<p>The elephants were frightened, and ran snorting and
trumpeting right up the road where Inches and his bearer
were standing. Inches was
very much frightened, and
ran too. But no harm was
done, and after a little while
Inches had a good laugh, when
he thought how the elephants
ran away from the little bustling
steamer.</p>

<p>After this was all over and the
elephants were slowly jogging along,
Inches and his bearer started on again. They met many
people; but very few of them were white. There were
only fifteen white children to be found for many miles:
so they, of course, knew each other well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Down the road, further on, they came to a sweetmeat-vender's
shop. His candies and sweets were put on flat
bamboo or cane plates, and all arranged outside the shop
itself, on a platform made of bamboo.</p>

<p>Inches wished Tezzan to buy some sweets for him; but
they had brought no <i>pice</i>, so could not. (Pice are small
copper coins used in India, worth about three-fourths of one
cent each.)</p>

<p>The little boy was on the point of crying, when he heard
his mamma calling; and, sure enough, there she was, and
papa, too, waiting for him in the pony-carriage. He ran
quickly, and climbed into his mamma's lap, and was soon
home again.</p>

<span class="smcap">When</span> the first little crocus peeped out of the ground,<br />
And slyly looked round,<br />
Not a flower was awake, not a bit of new green<br />
Was anywhere seen;<br />
And it seemed, with a shiver the little one said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Oh, I am afraid,</span><br />
The trees are so naked, the earth is so black!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Please let me go back!</span><br />

Then a bluebird whistled, "Oh, no! my dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">It is good you are here;</span><br />
For now we are sure that spring is near."<br />
Then a sober old robin came bustling by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With the sleep in his eye;</span><br />
"Ah, me! how stupid I was to wait;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And now I am late!</span><br />
The bluebird has piped, and the crocus has come;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And you know by the hum</span><br />
The hot little bee is beating his drum."<br />
<br />
Then sweet Mother Spring, with a sunshine kiss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said something like this:</span><br />
"Thanks, brave little crocus, so slender and small,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">For heeding my call</span><br />
While orchards were leafless, and snow-drifts staid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the all-day shade:</span><br />
You are telling us sweetly that soonest begun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The soonest is done;</span><br />

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
